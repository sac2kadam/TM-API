The AMRIT Telemedicine (TM) Service enhances the capabilities of Health and Wellness Centers (HWCs) by providing remote healthcare services, improving accessibility, enabling collaborative care, and integrating with other facilities such as drug dispensing and laboratory services.

## Features of Telemedicine (TM)

### **Telemedicine in Health and Wellness Centers (HWCs)**

Telemedicine is integral to HWCs, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in healthcare services.

1. **Teleconsultation** – HWCs use telemedicine for virtual consultations, allowing patients to connect with doctors via video calls for diagnoses, medical advice, and follow-ups, reducing the need for in-person visits.

2. **Improved Accessibility** – Patients in remote areas or with mobility issues can access healthcare conveniently without traveling to HWCs.

3. **Outpatient Services** – Telemedicine supports outpatient care by enabling virtual visits, follow-ups, and remote monitoring, ensuring timely medical attention without physical appointments.

4. **Medication Management** – Doctors can remotely prescribe medications, and patients can collect them from the HWC’s drug dispensing facility, ensuring a smooth medication process.

5. **Collaborative Care** – HWCs can consult specialists via telemedicine for expert opinions, ensuring comprehensive patient care through seamless collaboration.

6. **Integration with Laboratory Services** – IoT-enabled labs can transmit test data directly to the HWC’s application, facilitating real-time consultations and efficient interpretation of results.

Telemedicine strengthens HWCs by bridging geographical gaps, optimizing resources, and ensuring timely medical intervention.
